# Data Structures and Algorithms </n>
This repository contains the data structures and algorithms problems from Udacity Nanodegree program. \
The program link here [UdacityDSA](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256) \

There are 4 projects in this nanodegree 
## 1. Unscramble Computer Science Program 
In this project there 5 tasks that needs to completed. The dataset consist of calls and texts exchanged during Sept 2016.
Here in this project, it is expected to do runtime analysis.
